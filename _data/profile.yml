  <p>
    An aerospace engineer and physics enthusiast with a passion for developing, optimising, and integrating complex 
    systems. My experiences in space engineering focus on plasma dynamics, space weather effects on spacecraft systems, 
    and the development of Guidance-Navigation-and-Control and RF/Microwave technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond space applications, my interest extends to electromagnetic phenomena across multiple domains â€” exploring 
    their potential in high-frequency communications and metamaterial-based sensors.
  </p>
  <p>
    I pursue the development of advanced systems through the integration of multiphysics frameworks, computational 
    intelligence, and performance-driven design for aerospace, defence and nuclear technology.
