abstract: >-
  Study of bias-momentum geosynchronous spacecraft control for precise attitude alignment with ground targets under orbital deviations. The research simulates SSP perturbations, derives guidance commands, and uses roll-actuated control to enhance satellite tracking, communication stability, and Earth observation, with thruster activation managed through pulse-width pulse-frequency modulation.
