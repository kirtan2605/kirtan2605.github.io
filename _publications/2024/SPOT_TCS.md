  Devsign of thermal control system for the SPOT satellite, optimizing radiator sizing for thermal rejection and heater power for 60-70% duty cycles. 
  The system ensures equipment temperatures remain between -10°C and 25°C under extreme space conditions, based on satellite life and orbit analysis.
